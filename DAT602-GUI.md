# DAT602-Final Milestone

The project's last milestone involves building the game's GUI version through the use of windows forms. The forms are created through coding in C# language to construct different forms and interactions such as clicking buttons and closing forms. The process is very interesting but I would much prefer if I got more time to work on my interface so I can work on the procedure for certain data required from the database.

Working with those forms helps me understand the process of creating an application and game is much more complicated rather than the game logic itself.
