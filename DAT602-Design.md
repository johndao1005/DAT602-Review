# DAT602-Design

The first milestone is created to allow students to gather information and create a mockup of the application with given data. Through the process, a lot of experience with system design was taught and it is interesting to view programming from a different point of view as I was mainly learning about web design.

First of all, I worked on actions for users such as registering, logging in and editing user information than other access such as admin login which will present different windows. Those forms and design is based on estimation as the platform for the application to run on are unknown.

For the game logic, the design is a simple 10x10 field game in which users can move around and get items to gain points there is no complicated action such as attacking, shifting other player position...  The game should be simple and familiar to users so no complicated instruction is needed along the way in the game so it would be a move-and-collect type without any attack mechanism. On another hand, admin will be limited to game administration and users' control without access to the game as they can archive the same result by registering as a new player. Using an online application to speed up the wireframe process, I complete the wireframe which may change depending on the application will be designed. 

Afterwards, with the design complete, I could understand and picture the information that would be needed to run the game such as the location of the character will be related to the map as well as a session to ensure the game knows which character the current player is complete against. The relationship diagram really helps with the process.

During this milestone, I stumbled on some troubles with understanding the concept of relational database as I was first introduced to non-relational database structure through Firebase or MongoDB which is a bit different. In the end, after understanding the concept better, especially through the digram and design of the web application, I was starting to work on SQL skills.
